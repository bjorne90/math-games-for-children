## Features ‚ú®
- **Colorful and  fun graphics:** Bright colors, intresting animations, and engaging design to grab children's 
attention and make the game visually appealing.
- **User-friendly interface:** The game is easy to navigate, with clearly labeled buttons and intutive controls suitable for
children.
- **Multiple game modes:** Children can choose from four different arithmetic operations to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- **Personalized learning:** The game adapts to the child's skill level and adjusts the difficulty of the questions accordingly.
- **Positive reinforcement:** The game offers positive feedback and rewards for correct answers, encouraging children to keep playing and learning.

## How to Play üéÆ
1. When the game starts, children can select the type of math operation they want to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
2. Once they select the operation, the game presents a series of questions that gradually increase in difficulty.
3. Children can answer the questions by selecting the correct answer from a set of multiple-choice options.
4. For each correct answer, the child receives points and positive feedback, such as a congratulatory message or a star.
5. If the child answers incorrectly, the game provides feedback and the correct answer so they can learn from their mistake.
6. As children progress through the game, the questions become progressively more challenging, helping them build their skills and confidence in math.
